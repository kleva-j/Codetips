```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

## Documentation

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 16
- pnpm 8

### Directory Structure

- [`.github`](.github) — GitHub configuration including the CI workflow.<br>
- [`.husky`](.husky) — Husky configuration and hooks.<br>
- [`public`](./public) — Static assets such as robots.txt, images, and favicon.<br>
- [`src`](./src) — Application source code, including pages, components, styles.

### Scripts

- `pnpm dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `pnpm build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `pnpm start` — Starts the application in production mode.
- `pnpm type-check` — Validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `pnpm lint` — Runs ESLint for all files in the `src` directory.
- `pnpm format` — Runs Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.

### Path Mapping

TypeScript are pre-configured with custom path mappings. To import components or files, use the `@` prefix.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';

// To import images or other files from the public folder
import avatar from '@/public/avatar.png';
```

### Switch to Yarn/npm

This starter uses pnpm by default, but this choice is yours. If you'd like to switch to Yarn/npm, delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, install the dependencies with Yarn/npm, change the CI workflow, and Husky Git hooks to use Yarn/npm commands.
